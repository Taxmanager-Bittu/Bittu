                        <h3>What is a Profitable Financial Portfolio?</h3>
                        <p>Speaking if asked anyone would say that a profitable portfolio is the one which yields good returns from investments and the graph of returns is facing upwards. Although this is an incomplete description of a portfolio. For any
                            good composition of a portfolio, there are many other aspects to be looked into-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Diversification-</b> A good mixture of different types of investments and not counting on only one specific kind is primarily important for a progressive portfolio. A big factor for risk reduction is allocating your investments
                                to different types of assets. </li>
                            <li><b>Risk Management-</b> All investments should be planned so that industry-related and enterprise-related risks do not affect the portfolio's overall growth. So the key factor is investing in different avenues after carefully
                                studying the risks in these investments. </li>
                            <li><b>Time management-</b> Another facet to be seen before investing in different assets is the period for which you want to block your capital in any investment. Moreover your goal for building a financial portfolio for example
                                if you are reaching retirement age, your motive would be making less risky and less volatile investments. Otherwise, if you are not a conservative investor your choices would be in high performing sector as there will be
                                greater risk involved though changes in the market can be beneficial for you. So, the period for which these investments are made is also a big factor when planning a profitable financial portfolio.</li>
                            <li><b>Regularity-</b> After careful analysis of different stocks in the market it is important to timely monitor their growth and study the changes brought about in them due to various reasons in the market over some time. </li>
                            <li><b>Goals-</b> We all have various plans for our future growth. Some of them are short term and some require long-term planning, by building a financial portfolio with a specific purpose in mind.</li>
